# VBA Challenge: Stock Data Analysis

This repository contains a VBA script that analyzes stock data across multiple worksheets and calculates:

- Ticker symbol
- Total stock volume
- Quarterly change in stock price
- Percent change in stock price

The script applies conditional formatting for positive and negative changes and outputs the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total stock volume for each stock.

## How to Use:
1. Download the `Stock_Analysis_Script.vbs` file.
2. Open your Excel workbook containing the stock data.
3. Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor.
4. Insert the script into the editor and run the `AnalyzeAllSheets` macro.
